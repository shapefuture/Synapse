# Synapse Design Log

This file tracks significant design decisions, rationale, and alternatives considered during development.

## Initial Project Structure (2023-04-19)

- **Decision**: Organize the project as a multi-crate Rust workspace
- **Rationale**: 
  - Modularity: Clear separation of concerns between different compiler stages
  - Parallel development: Team members can work on different crates simultaneously
  - Reusability: Core libraries can be used by multiple tools
  - Testing: Easier to test individual components in isolation
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Single monolithic crate: Rejected due to poor modularity and potential for tight coupling
  - Multiple repositories: Rejected due to increased overhead in dependency management

## Core Semantic Representation (Planned)

- **Decision**: Use Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) as the core representation
- **Rationale**:
  - Graph structure allows for rich semantic relationships
  - Decouples syntax from semantics
  - Enables multiple projections (syntax forms) for the same semantic model
  - Facilitates AI-based code manipulation
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Traditional Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): Rejected as it's too tied to concrete syntax
  - Direct IR generation: Rejected as it would make semantic analysis more difficult

## Type System Architecture (Planned)

- **Decision**: Layered type system with progressive levels of sophistication
- **Rationale**:
  - Allows for incremental implementation and testing
  - Provides a clear migration path for codebases
  - Enables different verification guarantees at different levels
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Single comprehensive type system: Rejected due to implementation complexity
  - Optional type features: Rejected due to potential inconsistencies in semantics
