# Synapse Implementation & Design Audit

This file provides an authoritative, chronological audit of the Synapse language and toolchain development, validated as of v0.2.0. Each entry details major milestones, corresponding artefacts, and design decisions across phases specified in `plan.md`.

---

## Phase 0: Foundations

### Formal Semantics Specified
- **Artefacts:** `docs/semantics/core_v0.1.tex`, `proofs/semantics/core_v0.1.v`
- **Details:** Language defined as simply-typed lambda calculus with references/effects; operational semantics and type system rigorously set out and mechanized in Coq.
- **Best Practice:** Explicit tie between informal LaTeX and mechanized formal semantics; peer review for completeness.

### ASG Schema Established
- **Artefacts:** `schemas/asg_schema_v1.proto`, `docs/asg_schema_v1_rationale.md`
- **Notes:** Flat, ID-based schema for all code/data nodes, designed for efficient traversal/mutation/serialization.
- **Decision:** Structure enables robust analysis, mutation, and future extensibility.

### Core ASG Library (asg_core), Parser (lalrpop), Formatter
- **Artefacts:** Rust crates: `asg_core`, `parser_core`, `formatter_core`, with generated code, comprehensive error handling, and atomic graph ops.
- **Design:** Extensive unit and integration tests. Protobuf/serde serialization, deterministic hashing, roundtrip parsing, and psychologically accessible formatting.
- **Review:** Maintains Rust idioms, documentation, clean dependency separation.

### Synapse CLI Tool Introduced
- **Artefacts:** `synapse_cli` with subcommands: parse, format, lint, dump-asg; full error/color support, robust CLI.
- **CI:** Automated Github Actions for linting, style, build, and tests.

## Phase 1: Core Type and Compilation Pipeline

### Hindley-Milner Type Checker (type_checker_l1)
- **Artefacts:** `type_checker_l1` crate, leveraging a disciplined algorithm W, per-node type inference, with unit/integration tests.
- **Rationale:** Designed for upgradeability to System F.

### Intermediate Representation (UPIR core)
- **Artefacts:** `upir_core` crate; data structures for typed MLIR-style IR with module/function/block/op model and extensible dialects.
- **Integration:** Pretty-printing and validation.

### ASG-to-UPIR Lowering
- **Artefacts:** `asg_to_upir` crate; traverses ASG, emits UPIR functions/values, key helpers for type/value/block translation.

### UPIR-to-LLVM Lowering
- **Artefacts:** `upir_to_llvm` with inkwell; working type and function lowerer; validates round-trip at LLVM IR level.

### Minimal Runtime
- **Artefacts:** `synapse_runtime`; C ABI alloc/free, simple I/O for linking; build as staticlib.

### Full Pipeline CLI Integration
- **Artefacts:** `synapse_cli` now with compile, type check, effect check, IR dump; CLI and end-to-end runtime tests.

### Formal Soundness Proof
- **Artefacts:** `proofs/core_v0.1_soundness.v`, `docs/semantics/core_v0.1_soundness.md`
- **Status:** Theorems stated, scheme for preservation/progress, and mechanization sketch/admittance in Coq.

## Phase 2: Advanced Type/Effect System, ADTs, and Integration

### Schema v2 and Rationale
- **Artefacts:** `schemas/asg_schema_v2.proto`, `docs/asg_schema_v2_rationale.md`
- **Features:** TypeAbs (forall), TypeApp, DataDef (ADTs), DataMatch, per-node effect tags (effect_meta).

### Polymorphism and ADT Type Checker (type_checker_l2)
- **Artefacts:** `type_checker_l2`: System F + ADTs, exhaustive pattern match, unification, effect checking.
- **Tests:** Unit/integration tests for polymorphic identity, option ADT, effect contexts.

### UPIR and Lowering Pipeline Extended
- **Artefacts:** `upir_core` and `asg_to_upir` now support and carry type params, ADT declarations, match ops, effect annotations.

### LLVM Backend Extended
- **Artefacts:** `upir_to_llvm`; core.match stub and effect tag comment emission, future extension point for ADT/enum lowering.

### End-to-End CLI, Docs, and Integration
- **Artefacts:** CLI commands: `type-check-effects`, `lower-upir`; `README.md`, `docs/CLI.md`, effect and ADT rationale docs, expanded regression tests.
- **Real-world:** Full round-trip regression test for programs with ADTs, polymorphism, and effect tags, checking errors and outputs.

### Tag and Project Status
- **Tag:** `v0.2.0` (Major type system, ADT, and effect milestone)
- **Progress:** All tracked tasks in `plan.md` marked `[v]`.
- **Roadmap:** `ROADMAP.md` updated for Phase 3 priorities.

---

## Technical and Governance Notes

- **Practices:** All code written idiomatic, with robust error handling, clear module structure, and CLI UX.
- **Testing:** Multi-level: unit, integration, CLI, e2e; effect and ADT regression.
- **Documentation:** All major components have inline documentation, rationale, and end-user docs.
- **Auditability:** Every major phase summarized in this file and `plan.md` with artefacts/commit trail.
- **CI:** Continuous integration for all PRs and pushes.

## Next: Phase 3, Ecosystem, and AI Integration

- Community/user testing; public alpha readiness.
- Library expansion and formal effect/memory safety work.
- Optional: Begin foundation for AI integration, verified optimization, or further runtime/backends.
