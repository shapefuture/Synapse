# Synapse Implementation Progress
_This file summarizes the live implementation/progress state, for codebase and roadmap transparency._

Legend:
- [v] Complete / Implemented
- [~] In Progress / Partially Implemented
- [ ] Not Yet Started

---

## Phase 0: Foundational Formalism & Core ASG

- [v] P0T1: Formal Semantics Spec (LaTeX+Coq) — `docs/semantics/`, `proofs/core_v0.1_soundness.v`
- [v] P0T2: ASG Schema v1 — `schemas/asg_schema_v1.proto`, rationale docs
- [v] P0T3: Core ASG Library (Rust, Proto, Serde, Hash) — `asg_core/`, tested
- [v] P0T4: Minimal Parser & Printer — `parser_core/`, `formatter_core/`, round-trip tests
- [v] P0T5: Basic CLI (parse, lint, format, dump-asg) — `synapse_cli/` with CI/tests

---

## Phase 1: Basic Type Checking & Compilation

- [v] P1T1: Level 1 Type Checker (Hindley-Milner) — `type_checker_l1/`, covers parse/lint/annotate
- [v] P1T2: UPIR: Core IR, Dialects, Spec, Builder, Textual IR — `upir_core/` and docs
- [v] P1T3: ASG-to-UPIR Lowering — `asg_to_upir/` (lambda, apps, primitives, refs, pattern match infra)
- [v] P1T4: UPIR-to-LLVM Lowering — `upir_to_llvm/` (functions, arith, constant, match stub), tested
- [v] P1T5: Minimal Runtime (alloc/free/print) — `synapse_runtime/`, staticlib
- [v] P1T6: E2E Pipeline Integration & CLI — CLI compile pipeline, effect/ADT/poly support, integration tests
- [v] P1T7: Soundness Mechanization — `proofs/core_v0.1_soundness.v`, Coq

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Type System & Verification

- [v] P2T1: ASG Schema v2, Polymorphism, ADT, Effects — `schemas/asg_schema_v2.proto`, extended `asg_core`, rationale docs
- [v] P2T2: Level 2 Type Checking (System F Polymorphism, ADTs, Static Effect Tags) — `type_checker_l2/`, integration tests for ADT/TypeAbs/TypeApp, effect tag enforcement, CLI flag
- [v] P2T3: UPIR & Lowering for System F, ADTs, Effects — `upir_core/` with type params/ADT, `asg_to_upir/` lowering, tested
- [v] P2T4: UPIR-to-LLVM extended for match/effect metadata — `upir_to_llvm/`, backend stubs for arm lowering
- [v] P2T5: CLI E2E, effect commands, ADT/polymorphism roundtrip, user docs — `synapse_cli/`, tests, `docs/CLI.md`
- [v] P2T6: Soundness for System F subcase, progress in effect checks — `proofs/`, doc rationale
- [~] P2T7: (Partially) — Advanced effect/dependent type soundness, resource/capability/SMT machinery: some planned (in progress/not yet for full linearity/SMT/advanced dependent types)

---

## Phase 3: AI Integration & Developer Experience

- [~] LSP++: Project exists (`synapse_lsp/`), core wiring stubbed, but stability, performance and most handlers are pending.
- [~] AI APIs: Project exists (`synapse_ai_api/`), core methods planning/incomplete.
- [ ] ASPE (Syntax Projection): Planning note, py proto exists, but no real model or integration yet.
- [ ] Explainable Errors: LLM responses planned, but not wired into CLI/LSP.
- [ ] AI Tutor: Planning/prototype only, not implemented.
- [ ] Macro Expander: Project created, no robust implementation.
- [ ] Full docs/tests for AI features: pending.
  
---

## Phase 4–5: (Advanced Runtime, Verification, Ecosystem)

- [ ] UART adaptive runtime, advanced metaprogramming, full resource/capability system, FFI, quantum/GPU backends — planning/architecture, no stable code yet.
- [ ] Ethics checker, package manager, real-time collab, full self-hosting and verification, advanced security — not started

---

**Milestone:**  
- [v] Phase 2 (v0.2.0) complete: Polymorphic/ADT/effect system, pipeline & CLI, user docs/tests — Ready for next major innovations.

_Last audit: All features up to P2T6 implemented; AI, metaprogramming, and advanced verification/FFI collaboration phases are not yet production-ready. See plan.md for fine-grained future objectives._
