# Synapse Progress Audit & Codebase Verification

(as audited against plan.md and codebase at v0.2.0 milestone)

## Phase 0: Foundational Formalism & Core ASG

- [v] Formal Semantics (core lambda calc, docs+proofs)
- [v] ASG Schema v1 (`asg_schema_v1.proto`, rationale docs)
- [v] Core ASG Rust library (`asg_core`)
- [v] Minimal parser/formatter (`parser_core`, `formatter_core`), roundtrip+test
- [v] Basic CLI tool + linter + CI (`synapse_cli`)
- [v] Integration/unit tests for all

## Phase 1: Core Type Checking & Compilation

- [v] Hindley-Milner type checker (`type_checker_l1`)
- [v] UPIR definition & dialects (`upir_core`)
- [v] ASG to UPIR lowering (`asg_to_upir`)
- [v] UPIR to LLVM lowering (`upir_to_llvm`)
- [v] Minimal runtime (`synapse_runtime`)
- [v] End-to-end CLI integration & runtime tests
- [v] Formal soundness proof (core) `proofs/core_v0.1_soundness.v`

## Phase 2: System F Polymorphism, ADTs, Effect System

- [v] ASG v2 schema + rationale (param. polymorphism, ADT, effects)
- [v] Type checker v2 (`type_checker_l2`); tests for ADT, poly, effect
- [v] UPIR extended for ADT/TypeAbs/effects; lowering support
- [v] Pattern match, ADT, "core.match" in backend; effect metadata, propagation
- [v] CLI + documentation reflect all new features
- [v] End-to-end and regression tests for all new features

## Not Yet Started (Scaffolded/Planned, not implemented):

- [ ] Phase 3: AI integration, LSP++, AI APIs, explainables, tutor, metaprogramming
- [ ] Phase 4: Advanced runtime (UART), FFI, GPU/quantum, holographic debugging, ethics, packages, collaboration
- [ ] Phase 5: Self-hosting, full verification, AI-driven optimization, governance, advanced security

**All code, doc, and test artefacts for Phases 0, 1, and 2 have been found to exist and match completion criteria in plan.md. No missing or incomplete core features for these stages were found in codebase audit. Pipeline is ready for next major phase.**
