# Synapse UART: Universal Adaptive Runtime

Phase 4 implementation of the advanced, extensible runtime for Synapse applications.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Task Scheduling**: Work-stealing scheduler with priority queues and adaptive scheduling policies.
- **First-Class Effect Handlers**: Capability-based effect system that bridges static and dynamic effect checking.
- **Quantitative Memory Management**: Explicit memory management with regions, controlled lifetimes, and safe reclamation.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers, retry policies, and failure isolation to build resilient applications.
- **Runtime Profiles**: Preconfigured profiles for different deployment scenarios (Standard, Embedded, Safety, Debug).
- **Holographic Debugger Integration**: Built-in tracing points for the advanced debugging infrastructure.

## Components

1. **Scheduler**: Task creation, scheduling, and prioritization with work-stealing.
2. **Effect System**: Runtime representation of effect types, handlers, and capability checking.
3. **Memory Manager**: Explicit memory regions, safe reclamation, and leak detection.
4. **Fault Manager**: Error handling, recovery, and resilience patterns.
5. **Configuration**: Flexible runtime tuning for deployment scenarios.

## Usage

```rust
// Create a runtime with a specific profile
let runtime = UartRuntime::with_config(RuntimeProfile::Standard.config())?;

// Start runtime
runtime.start()?;

// Spawn a task
let task = runtime.spawn(|| {
    // Task code
    Ok(())
})?;

// Spawn a task with specific effect capabilities
let task = runtime.spawn_with_effects(
    || {
        // Perform an IO effect
        runtime.effect_system().invoke(
            EffectInvocation::new("IO", "println")
                .with_param("Hello, world!")
        )?;
        Ok(())
    },
    vec![EffectCap::io()]
)?;

// Allocate memory with explicit management
let region = runtime.memory_manager().create_region("my_region")?;
let value = region.allocate(42)?;

// Use fault tolerance patterns
runtime.fault_manager().with_retry(
    || {
        // Operation that might fail
        Ok(())
    },
    RetryPolicy::new(3)
)?;

// Shutdown runtime gracefully
runtime.shutdown()?;
```

## Integration

- Bridges the gap between the Synapse compiler's static type & effect system and runtime enforcement
- Provides a foundation for the UPIR-to-UART and other backend lowering pipelines
- Integrates with the holographic debugger for comprehensive runtime visibility
- Enables advanced concurrency patterns with effect-based coordination

## Next Steps

- Integration with MLIR lowering pipelines
- Runtime verification of key invariants and properties
- Specialized backends for GPU, Quantum, and heterogeneous computing
- Full-featured streaming and actor model libraries
