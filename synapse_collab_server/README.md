# Synapse Collaborative Server

Phase 4 implementation of real-time collaborative editing and session management for Synapse projects.

## Features

- User/session tracking with unique session IDs
- Document store with versioned updates
- Real-time sync primitives for text/code editing
- Basic event system for join/leave/edit
- (Future) CRDTs for reliable distributed editing

## Usage

- See `src/session.rs` for session management
- See `src/sync.rs` for document synchronization
- See `src/doc.rs` for event tracking
- See `src/crdt.rs` for distributed editing logic

## Next Steps

- Integrate with package manager and registry for collaborative package/project development
- Add advanced CRDT algorithms for distributed conflict-free editing
- Add WebSocket/REST API for front-end/editor integration
