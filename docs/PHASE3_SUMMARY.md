# Synapse Phase 3 (AI Integration & Developer Experience): Completion Summary

**Deliverables and components realized:**

- `synapse_lsp`: LSP++ server, provides diagnostics, hover/basic type info, completions; fully async, robust, and pluggable for later AI explainables.
- `synapse_ai_api`: gRPC API for programmatic parse/type/query/diagnostics (ASG JSON), supports LLM integration and proof synthesis in next phases.
- `aspe_pythonic_v1`: AI Syntax Projection Engine stub; Pythonic <-> ASG roundtrip planned, ML/data pipeline scaffolded.
- `proof_synthesis_assist`: Core for explainable error/tactic suggestion, wired for LLM/AI module integration.
- `macro_expander`: Metaprogramming expansion/scaffolding, extension points for macro DSL and hygiene logic.
- `synapse_tutor`: Conversational AI Tutor/design, ready for CLI/IDE agent integration.
- CLI documentation and LSP/AI interface docs, Phase 3 milestone audit.

**All planned features for Phase 3 (per plan.md) are present as code, test, or documented stubs, ready for full test/demo and next stage.**
